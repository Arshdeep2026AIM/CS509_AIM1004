## Assignment 02: Graph Analytics (Triangle Counting, Betweenness Centrality, Connected Components)

### Assignment Mode
Double / Buddy

### Objective
Implement structural graph analysis algorithms on unweighted, undirected graphs using Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) format:
1. Triangle Counting using neighbor list intersections.
2. Betweenness Centrality using Brandes' Algorithm.
3. Connected Components labeling via BFS/DFS or Union-Find.

### Algorithm / Approach
1. **Triangle Counting:** Sorts neighbor lists in CSR representation to perform efficient common-neighbor checks for connected pairs. Divides total discovery count by 3.
2. **Betweenness Centrality:** Computes unnormalized Brandes' centrality for unweighted graphs by running BFS from all source vertices and accumulating shortest path dependencies.
3. **Connected Components:** Uses graph traversal (BFS/DFS) or Disjoint Set Union (DSU) to assign unique sequential component IDs to all vertices.

### Input Format
Text files in the following format:

#### For Unweighted Adjacency-List
V E
u0 degree neighbor1 neighbor2 ...
u1 degree neighbor1 neighbor2 ...
...
u(V-1) degree neighbor1 neighbor2 ...
SOURCE s
V: number of vertices.
E: number of edges. For an undirected graph, count each graph edge once in E even though it appears in both adjacency lists.
u: vertex whose adjacency list is being written.
degree: number of neighbours listed after u.
s: source vertex for BFS or DFS.

#### For weighted Adjacency-List
V E
u0 degree neighbor1 weight1 neighbor2 weight2 ...
u1 degree neighbor1 weight1 neighbor2 weight2 ...
...
u(V-1) degree neighbor1 weight1 neighbor2 weight2 ...
SOURCE s

### Helper Functions / CSR Conversion
Pre-processes adjacency lists into CSR format (`row_ptr`, `col_idx`) before timer invocation. Neighbor lists are pre-sorted for optimized triangle counting intersections.

### File Structure
* `csr.h` / `csr.cpp`: Adjacency list to CSR conversion and sorting routines.
* `triangle_counting.h` / `triangle_counting.cpp`: Intersection-based triangle counting logic.
* `betweenness_centrality.h` / `betweenness_centrality.cpp`: Brandes' centrality algorithm.
* `connected_components.h` / `connected_components.cpp`: Component identification routines.
* `driver.cpp`: Dedicated driver module for input validation, CSR construction, timed execution calls, and result printing.
